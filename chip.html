		Chippy is a sweet soul, just like his dad, he aims to please and is very affectionate, 
		he too is a superstar at any activity he is thrown into, his biggest love is scent work, 
		but is great at Hoopers, tricks and everyday obedience. He is praise and food driven.
		<br><br>
		His natural bobtail never stops wiggling, it is so cute, he is just the happiest dog you would ever meet! 
		<br><br>
		Chippy is the biggest of the 2020 litter, he is a Lean, muscled and fit man, 
		weighing in at 17kg and a height of 55cm (floor to shoulders).
		<br><br> He has both the traditional French Brittany looks with the American Brittany build.
		<br><br>He is happiest at home with his people being a smooch, he does love running free in big open spaces though,
		he has beautiful recall and isnâ€™t as wide roaming as his parents, he is a bit of a mammas boy
