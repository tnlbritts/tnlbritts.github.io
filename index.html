		<br><br>
		We like to think of ourselves as artisan breeders; our prefix is an abbreviation of our core goal, Temperament Not Looks - it also so happens to be the initials for the names of our beautiful dogs, Tucker n Lola!
		We know that looks are lovely, no one can resist a cute puppy, but like everything, looks will fade with time, a pet with great temperament and personality stays beautiful forever!  
		We're also just lucky Tucker n Lola are lookers anyway, so rest assured their puppies will be too!
		<br><br>
		All About Tucker (Dad)
		<br><br>
		Tucker is a personality plus little guy, he aims to please and is very affectionate, 
		he is a superstar at any activity he is thrown into, his biggest loves are Agility & Scent work,
		but is great at tricks and everyday obedience - he is praise driven
		He has always been the star in all his classes!  One of his litter mates was an acting dog, must be in the genes!
		He is a natural bobtail; which in his first litter, he passed on to all his offspring
		Tucker is a lean, muscled and fit man, weighing in at 15kg and a height of 50cm (floor to shoulders), he has traditional the French Brittany looks
		He comes from hunting stock with built in skills!  although never trained in the hunt he would have made a great hunting companion, he has exceptional skills in the bush and water
		He is happiest at home with his people being a smooch, he does love running free in big open spaces though!
		CHEDS Hip & Elbow Score:
		5 out of a possible 106
		<br>
		<br>
		All About Lola (Mum)
		<br>
		<br>
		Lola is a super sweet little girl, she is very smart but reserved, she is very good at reading a room!
		She is extremely tolerant of children, in her eyes little kids could do no wrong, she is a natural born mother!  She dotes on her babies, giving them all the love and milk they desire, she really sets the up for success.
		Lola came from a show line pedigree, and she can work it! Her natural show ring gait is the biggest give away! She truly is a little princess when out walking, she turns heads!
		That said, she too is a natural born hunter!  Bird mad, when she spots them, the drive is unreal!  it’s great to watch!
		Lola loves getting dirty while out playing, especially when her nose takes her off on a wild adventure!
		She also is easily trained, not the class star, but middle to top of the rung, she enjoys it all!  She likes scent work the most, but excels at tricks - she is very food driven
		Lola is also a lean and fit individual at 14kg and a height of 50cm (floor to shoulders), she has American Brittany looks - with a full-length tail with gorgeous feathers!
		She is happiest out following her nose wherever there is water - it has to be very cold for her to stay out the water!  She is a little wierdo and makes us laugh daily with her antics!
		CHEDS Hip & Elbow Score:
		7 out of a possible 106
		
		<br><br>
		All About Chippy (the child)
		<br><br>
		Chippy is a sweet soul, just like his dad, he aims to please and is very affectionate, he too is a superstar at any activity he is thrown into, his biggest love is Scent work, but is great at Hoopers, tricks and everyday obedience - he is praise and food driven
		His natural bobtail never stops wiggling, it is so cute, he is just the happiest dog you would ever meet!
		Chippy is the biggest of the 2020 litter, he is a Lean, muscled and fit man, weighing in at 17kg and a height of 55cm (floor to shoulders), he has both the traditional French Brittany looks with the American Brittany build
		He is happiest at home with his people being a smooch, he does love running free in big open spaces though, he has beautiful recall and isn’t as wide roaming as his parents, he is a bit of a mammas boy
		
		<br><br>
		A little about our dogs and what to expect from their puppies
		<br><br>
		
		Our Brittany's are lean and compact with fine coats with leg feathering, not overly hairy, they are wash and wear dogs with no need to clip - just bath when dirty or smelly and brush occasionally – low/medium shed in the house
		The litter were all born natural bob tails, one slightly longer than the others, maybe 1/3 length
		They are active dogs, but we feel it’s a misconception that this equates to needing excessive exercise, we find they get silly when too tired out, just like small children.
		We find 45 minutes of stimulating activity is the magic number for our guys, a run, swim or sniffy brisk walk daily with training at home works great, but always mix it up, not the same boring walk every day.
		Our dogs go to dedicated training roughly 1-2 times a week each, depending on the schedules, we like to mix it up, Scent work, Hoopers, Tricks etc
		A 45 minute training session really takes it out of them mentally and physically - which makes for a better home life
		<br><br>
		Brittany's need your time and attention, they are not suitable for exclusively yard life - our pups enjoy the fresh air when are at work but as soon as we are home they are inside with us at all times, this is not negotiable
		They love car rides and coming with us wherever we are going, they very rarely miss out on adventures with us.
		We take them camping, they sleep in hammocks with us and we have special camping muzzles for them to save them from the dreaded 1080 baits as like to explore the bush when not hunkered down with us at the fire
		They are adventurous dogs, not for the feint hearted, they always return, but Brittany's wander far!  Do not expect their pups to potter by your side!  All the training in the world won’t stop a Britt’s nose!
		<br><br>
		CHEDS Hip and Elbow scoring was done when our dogs were both finished growing, at around 2 years of age; for those not in the know, the lower the score the better and some breeders do the scans when the dogs are growing still (around 1year) which can give false or misleading scores.
		Tucker scored 5 and Lola scored 7 out of a possible 106 - The current five-year breed average for the Brittany is 12.22 and the median is 9.00, so needless to say they passed with flying colours!  
		This great scoring was the final decision for us whether to breed them or not, we wanted to ensure the best start for future progeny
		A little about what we do for the pups and the future custodians 
		<br><br>
		Tucker n Lola’s litter will be registered with MDBA with pedigree papers, you should note, this will be a litter of pets!  These papers are not ANKC papers, as such these puppies will not be eligible for showing and certain events that are held by ANKC
		Anyone looking for a purebred Brittany for showing or competitive trialling should seek a breeder from Dogz Online
		We have chosen MDBA to register our litter as they fall in line with our personal values, we have found that ANKC does not and some of its members participate in acts we find wrong and not in the best interests of the dogs.
		That said, Tucker n Lola’s puppies will be able to participate in ALL the important things a dog’s life has to offer!
		<br><br>
		We hope to set their pups for success and will be actively helped through their first fear stages, roughly weeks 5 & 8-10 by ensuring all the areas are covered off so future events don’t trigger unwanted behaviours
		The pups will be exposed to all number of experiences in a positive and upbeat ways, including Vet visits, car rides and crate training.  Our dogs are routinely trained with the Relaxation Protocol guided training and the puppies will be raised following the “Puppy Culture” guided program to ensure we set them up with the best possible start
		As part of this, the puppies will be used to nail clipping, grooming, handling and will have already had a bunch of great socialising events in their short little time with us.  They will be used to eating from Kongs, lickimats etc and will be desensitised during this time to a number of common sounds and events, like lawn mowers, vacuums and fireworks.
		Assessment will be made on an individual basis as to when they are ready for their new home, puppies are individual and need to be treated as such, some might be ready to join their new home at 8 weeks, some may need mum a little longer - don’t expect a pup at exactly 8 weeks.  This approach has many benefits, most being they will be more likely to be well adjusted dogs when they grow up, no dog owner wants a problem pet!
		The pups will come from a loving home, will have been vet checked, had first vaccination, regularly wormed and microchipped. A puppy care package will accompany them with lots of goodies, including a blanket with mum and litter scents, feeding guidelines and plenty of other resources and information you will need plus their papers.
		We are only a phone call or email away and will be happy to help and you can watch the puppies 24/7 on puppy-cam! LINK
