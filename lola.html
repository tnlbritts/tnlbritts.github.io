		Lola is a super sweet little girl, she is very smart but reserved, she is very good at reading a room! 
		She is extremely tolerant of children, in her eyes little kids could do no wrong, 
		<br><br>
		She is a natural born mother! She dotes on her babies, giving them all the love and milk they desire, 
		she really sets the up for success. Lola came from a show line pedigree, and she can work it! 
		<br><br>Her natural show ring gait is the biggest give away! She truly is a little princess when out walking, 
		she turns heads! That said, she too is a natural born hunter! Bird mad, when she spots them, 
		the drive is unreal! itâ€™s great to watch! Lola loves getting dirty while out playing, 
		especially when her nose takes her off on a wild adventure! <br><br>She also is easily trained, 
		not the class star, but middle to top of the rung, she enjoys it all! She likes scent work the most, 
		but excels at tricks. She is very food driven.
		<br><br>
		Lola is also a lean and fit individual at 14kg and a height of 50cm (floor to shoulders), 
		<br><br>
		She has American Brittany looks - with a full-length tail with gorgeous feathers! 
		<br><br>
		She is happiest out following her nose wherever there is water - it has to be very cold for her to stay out the water! 
		She is a little wierdo and makes us laugh daily with her antics! 
		<br><br>
		CHEDS Hip & Elbow Score: 7 out of a possible 106
