		Tucker is a personality plus little guy, he aims to please and is very affectionate, 
		he is a superstar at any activity he is thrown into, his biggest loves are Agility & Scent work,
		but is great at tricks and everyday obedience - he is praise driven.
		<br>
		He has always been the star in all his classes!  One of his litter mates was an acting dog, must be in the genes!
		He is a natural bobtail; which in his first litter, he passed on to all his offspring
		<br>
		Tucker is a lean, muscled and fit man, weighing in at 15kg and a height of 50cm (floor to shoulders),
		he has traditional the French Brittany looks. He comes from hunting stock with built in skills! 
		<br>
		Although never trained in the hunt he would have made a great hunting companion, he has exceptional skills in the bush and water
		<br>
		He is happiest at home with his people being a smooch, he does love running free in big open spaces though!
